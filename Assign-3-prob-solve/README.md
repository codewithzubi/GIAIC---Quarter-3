Assignment 3: Problem-Solving Challenges (Class-4)

This repository contains solutions to three common programming challenges related to strings and numbers. Each problem is solved using Python functions. Below are the challenges and their respective solutions.


# Assignment 3 – Basic Coding Challenges (Class 4)
This project includes beginner-level Python solutions to three simple but important problems. These problems are based on string handling and number operations. Every solution is written in a clean and easy-to-understand way using basic Python functions.

## Included Challenges:
Reverse a Word or Sentence
A function that takes any text (like a word or sentence) and returns it in reverse order.

Count the Vowels in Text
A small program that counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are present in a word or sentence. Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Add the Digits of a Number
A function that takes a number and returns the total of its digits. It works using two different methods – one with a loop and one using string conversion.
