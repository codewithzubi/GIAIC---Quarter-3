## 1. **Mass-Energy Equivalence (E = mc²)**

### Description

This program takes the mass (in kilograms) as input from the user and calculates the equivalent energy using **Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula**:  
`E = m * c²`  
Where:
- `E` is energy
- `m` is mass (in kilograms)
- `c` is the speed of light (299792458 m/s)

### How It Works:
1. The user is asked to input the mass.
2. The energy is calculated using the formula `E = m * c²`.
3. The result is printed out.

### Example Output:
